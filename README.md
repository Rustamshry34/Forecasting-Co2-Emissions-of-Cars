# Forecasting-Co2-Emissions-of-Cars

I completed: 

1. Load dataset from the “CO2 Emissions.csv” csv file.
3. Explore dataset and check if there is any column with missing values.
4. Select your input variables.
5. Split dataset as %80 training and %20 testing.
6. Scale training data and testing data inputs.
7. Implement neural network object using the ski-learn python library.
8. Train (fit) network.
9. Report the accuracy (R2 score) of the neural network for the test datasets.
10. Make a prediction for the given input values: Engine Size(L) = 5.6 Cylinders= 8 Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km) =17.5 Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km) = 12 Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km) =15 and Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg) = 19
